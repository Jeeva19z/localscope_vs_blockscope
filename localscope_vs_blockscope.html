<title>Local Variables and Block-Scoped Variables</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Local Variables:</h2>

<p>Local variables are declared using the <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, or <code>const</code> keyword inside a function.</p>
<p>They are accessible only within the function in which they are declared.</p>
<p>Local variables are created when the function is called and destroyed when the function exits.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">function exampleFunction() {
    var localVar = "I am a local variable";
    console.log(localVar);
}

exampleFunction(); // Output: "I am a local variable"
// console.log(localVar); // This will cause an error: "Uncaught ReferenceError: localVar is not defined"
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Block-Scoped Variables:</h2>

<p>Block-scoped variables are declared using the <code>let</code> or <code>const</code> keyword within a block of code, such as an <code>if</code> statement or a loop.</p>
<p>They are accessible only within the block in which they are declared, and they are not visible outside of that block.</p>
<p>Block-scoped variables have a more limited scope compared to local variables, which are scoped to the entire function.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">function exampleFunction() {
    if (true) {
        let blockVar = "I am a block-scoped variable";
        console.log(blockVar);
    }
    // console.log(blockVar); // This will cause an error: "Uncaught ReferenceError: blockVar is not defined"
}

exampleFunction(); // Output: "I am a block-scoped variable"
</code></pre>

<p>So, while both local variables and block-scoped variables are scoped to a specific block of code, block-scoped variables have a narrower scope and are limited to the block in which they are declared. Additionally, block-scoped variables provide better control over variable visibility and help prevent unintended variable hoisting and leakage.</p>
